Agence Ecofin cites a statement from the Equatorial Guinea Embassy in France, confirming that on 26 September 2018 the African country’s government signed an agreement with Orange Middle East & Africa under which it paid EUR50 million (USD57.5 million) to the French-based telecoms giant in return for relinquishing Getesa shares. The final payment followed Equatorial Guinea’s initial share payment to Orange of EUR45 million in October 2016, thereby settling the balance of an agreed EUR95 million redemption price for Orange's 40% stake.",
